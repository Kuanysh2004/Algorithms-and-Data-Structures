I have implemented a Dynamic Segment Tree that facilitates the sum operation within a specified range [l, r]. For additional information, you can refer to 
the details provided [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-segment-trees-online-queries-for-range-sum-with-point-updates/). Moreover, I utilized std::unique_ptr 
instead of std::shared_ptr to enhance memory efficiency.
